API key is set as environment variable
Run order is get_chall, get_puuid, get_match

api rate limit is 20 per sec, 100 per 2 min, per region, (e.g na1, euw1, americas)

Get_chall -> Get_puuid -> Get_match, thats pretty much extracting it done, then need to acutally make some tables within, with is the transform part..
Need to design a scheme i want, once i have that should be pretty simple to transform it and that.
